“Musify, THE MUSIC WEBSITE” 

Simple music player built with React and inspired by Spotify.

This project is about the mp3 music player application development using Android. The biggest difference between this music player and the existing applications is that it is completely free for users to use. It integrates the advantages of existing music players on the market, as far as possible mining out the existing music players' function, and then filtering in order to eliminate functions that are not practical or cost-effective. Also, it will be continuously improved based on user feedback.Due to the iterative and flexible nature of this approach, it is able to effectively adapt to users with changing requirements.
